This file describes all ELLE functions, and is in a specific format for use
by the "Describe" function (normally invoked by the command ^_).
	Each function is identified by a number (which matches its
internal index as defined by deffun.e), and by a name to the right of
the number.  All text up to the first blank line is considered part of
the documentation for that function.

<F0> -- undefined --
	This command does not have any defined function assigned to it.

<F1> Insert Self
	The character is inserted into the buffer.

<F2> Quoted Insert
	Reads a character and inserts it.

<F3> CRLF
	Insert CRLF (End Of Line), or move onto blank line.
	A blank line is one containing only spaces and tabs
	(which are killed if we move onto it).  Single blank lines
	(followed by nonblank lines) are not eaten up this way.

<F4> Forward Character
	Moves forward one character.
	With argument, moves that many characters forward.
	Negative args move backward.

<F5> Backward Character
	Moves back one character.
	With argument, moves that many characters backward.
	Negative args move forward.

<F6> Delete Character
	Deletes character after point.
	With argument, kills (and saves) that many characters.
	Negative args kill characters backward.

<F7> Backward Delete Character
	Deletes character before point.
	With argument, kills (and saves) that many characters.
	Negative args kill characters forward.

<F8> Delete Horizontal Space
	Deletes all spaces and tabs around point.

<F9> Transpose Characters
	Transposes the characters before and after the cursor.

<F10> Forward Word
	Moves forward over one word.

<F11> Backward Word
	Moves backward over one word.

<F12> Kill Word
	Kills next word.

<F13> Backward Kill Word
	Kills last word.

<F14> Transpose Words
	Transposes the words before and after the cursor.

<F15> Uppercase Word
	Converts one word to upper case, moving past it.
	With arg, applies to that many words backward or forward.

<F16> Lowercase Word
	Converts one word to lower case, moving past it.
	With arg, applies to that many words backward or forward.

<F17> Uppercase Initial
	Puts next word in lower case, but capitalize initial.
	With arg, applies to that many words backward or forward.

	Moves to beginning of line.

<F21> End of Line
	Moves to end of line.

<F22> Next Line
	Moves to beginning of next line.

<F23> Previous Line
	Moves to beginning of previous line.

<F24> Down Real Line
	Moves down vertically to next real line.
	Continuation lines are skipped.  If given after the
	last LF in the buffer, makes a new one at the end.

<F25> Up Real Line
	Moves up vertically to next real line.
	Continuation lines are skipped.

<F26> Open Line
	Inserts an EOL (End Of Line) after point.
	Differs from ordinary insertion in that point remains
	before the inserted characters.
	With argument, inserts several EOLs.

<F27> Delete Blank Lines
	Kills all blank lines around point.

<F28> Kill Line

	At the end of a line (only blanks following), kills through the EOL.
	Otherwise, kills the rest of the line but not the EOL.
	With argument (positive or negative), kills specified number of lines.
	Killed text is pushed onto the kill ring for retrieval.

<F29> Backward Kill Line
	Kills from point backwards to beginning of line.
	With argument, same as Kill Line with negative arg.

<F30> Goto Line
	Goes to the line number specified by the argument.  The first

	Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines or by
	lines which start with "." or "-".

<F46> Backward Paragraph
	Moves backward to beginning of paragraph.

<F47> Mark Paragraph
	Puts point and mark around this paragraph.

<F48> Fill Paragraph
	Fills (or adjusts) this (or next) paragraph.
	Point stays the same (but text may move past it due to filling).

<F49> reserved

<F50> Select Buffer
	Selects or creates buffer with specified name.
	If there is a buffer with that name, it is selected.
	Otherwise, a buffer with that name is created and selected.

<F51> Select Existing Buffer
	Like Select Buffer but never creates a new buffer.  A partial
	name may be given.

<F54> Buffer Not Modified
	Pretends that this buffer hasn't been modified.
	The "*" flag will disappear.

<F55> EOL CRLF Mode
	Toggles the interpretation of EOL (End-Of-Line) for the current
	buffer.  An EOL may be either a CR-LF (Carriage-Return = ^M,
	and LineFeed = ^J) together, or a LF alone.
	In LF mode: LF alone is considered to be EOL.
		This is the normal mode for Unix systems.
	In CRLF mode: both CR and LF must exist to be counted as an EOL.
		This is the normal mode for TOPS-20 systems.

	as using Grow Window on the other window.
	With argument, shrinks that many lines.

<F75> Delete Window

	If using 2 windows, deletes the current window, and
	the other window becomes the single remaining window.

<F76> Standout Window
	Toggles the display standout mode for the current window.
	With argument of 4, toggles the standout mode for the non-buffer
	parts of the screen, such as the ELLE mode line.
	With argument of 0, turns standout mode off for all windows.

<F77> Two Mode Windows

	two windows in use.  Normally set to 1 at startup.
	With argument of:
		0 - Use only 1 mode line (at the bottom).
		1 - Use 2 mode lines only if they are in standout mode.
		2 - Always use 2 mode lines, one for each window.
	With no argument, toggles the current setting between 0 and 2.

<F78> New Window
	Chooses new window putting point at center, top or bottom.
	With no argument, clears the screen and chooses a window
	which has point roughly at the center.
	An argument gives the line to put point on.
	C-U as argument redisplays only the line containing point.

<F79> Next Screen

	E.G. Turns a following A into Meta-A.

<F92> Prefix Extend
	This is an extended command prefix with many subcommands.

<F93> Universal Arg
	Sets argument or multiplies it by four.
	Followed by digits, uses them to specify the
	argument for the command after the digits.
	If not followed by digits, multiplies the argument by four.

<F94> Negative Argument
	Starts an argument collection, like Universal Arg, but
	makes the resulting arg negative.

<F95> Argument Digit
	Collects an argument for the next command, starting with this
	digit.

<F96> VT100 Button Hack

	after this command, up to an "End Kbd Macro" command, will
	be both executed and stored as the definition of the current
	keyboard macro.

<F101> End Kbd Macro
	Stops collecting a keyboard macro.

<F102> Execute Kbd Macro
	Executes the currently defined keyboard macro.

<F103> View Kbd Macro

	Puts point after it and the mark before it.

<F106> Un-kill Pop 
	Corrects after Un-kill to use an earlier kill.
	Requires that the region contain the most recent killed stuff,
	as it does immediately after using Un-kill.
	It is deleted and replaced with the previous killed stuff,
	which is rotated to the front of the ring buffer.

<F107> Append Next Kill
	Makes following kill commands append to last batch.
	Thus, C-K C-K, cursor motion, this command, and C-K C-K,
	generate one block of killed stuff, containing two lines.

<F108> reserved

<F109> reserved

<F110> String Search
	Searches forward for string.  Asks for a string; CR or ESCAPE
	terminates the string.

<F111> Reverse String Search
	Searches backward for string.  Asks for a string; CR or ESCAPE
	terminates the string.

<F112> Incremental Search
	Searches for character string as you type it.
	C-Q quotes special characters.  DEL cancels last character.
	C-S repeats the search, forward, and C-R repeats it backward.
	C-R or C-S with search string empty changes the direction of search
	or brings back search string from previous search.
	ESCAPE exits the search; with search string empty
	it switches to non-incremental String Search.
	Other Control and Meta chars exit the search and then are executed.
	If not all the input string can be found, the rest is not discarded.
	You can rub it out, discard it all with C-G, exit,
	or use C-R or C-S to search the other way.
	Quitting a successful search aborts the search and moves point back;
	quitting a failing search just discards whatever input wasn't found.

<F113> Reverse Search
	Does reverse Incremental Search.
	See info for Incremental Search.

<F114> Replace String
	Replaces one string with another, globally.
	Works by calling Query Replace and pretending you typed a !.

<F115> Query Replace
	Replaces a string interactively.
	Asks for "Replace string:" (you type old string, eg FOO)
	Then asks " with string:" (you type new string, eg BAR)
	Then moves to and shows each each occurrence of FOO,
	and you must then type a character to say what to do:
	? => Shows brief summary of this list.
	Space => replace it with BAR and show next FOO.
	DEL => don't replace, but show next FOO.
	^L => redisplay screen.
	^ => return to site of previous FOO (actually, jump to mark).
	! => replace all remaining FOOs without asking.
	ESCAPE => just exit.
	. => replace this FOO and exit.
	, => replace this FOO and show result, waiting for next command.
	Not yet: ^W => kill this FOO and enter recursive editing level.
	Not yet: ^R => enter recursive editing level.
	Any other character exits and is read again.

<F116> Replace in Line
	Like Replace String but only operates on the current line.
	Asks for the string to replace, then the string to replace it with.

<F117> Set Fill Column
	Sets fill column to numeric arg or current column.
	If there is an argument, that is used.
	Otherwise, the current position of the cursor is used.
	The Fill Column variable controls where Auto Fill mode
	and Fill Paragraph put the right margin.

<F118> Set Fill Prefix
	EMACS: Defines Fill Prefix from current line.
	All of the current line up to point becomes the value
	of Fill Prefix.  Auto Fill Mode and Linefeed insert the
	prefix on each line;  ^R Fill Region assumes that each
	non-blank line starts with the prefix (which is ignored
	for filling purposes).
	To stop using a Fill Prefix, do ^R Set Fill Prefix
	at the front of a line.

<F119> Auto Fill Mode
	Turns Auto Fill mode on and off.  When on, the word
	"Fill" will appear in the mode line, and typing a space
	when beyond the current Fill Column will cause the
	current line to be automatically filled.

<F120> Text Mode
	An IMAGEN-specific function.  Resembles Auto Fill Mode.

<F121> Indent According to Mode
	Indents suitably for the major mode.
	In Fundamental mode, just inserts a tab.

<F122> Indent New Line
	Inserts CRLF (End Of Line), then indents the second line.
	Uses the definitions of CR and Tab to do the work.

<F123> Back to Indentation
	Moves to end of current line's indentation.

<F124> Indent for Comment
	Moves to start of existing comment or creates new one,
	and indents it to start in Comment Column.
	This doesn't work well yet.

<F125> Indent Relative
	Attempts to indent current line by the same amount as the
	previous line.

<F126> reserved

<F127> reserved

<F128> reserved

<F129> Match Bracket
	Similar to EMACS' "Show Matching Paren".

<F130> Push to Inferior
	Starts an inferior shell process.  Exitting this shell will
	return to ELLE.

<F131> Return to Superior
	If system permits, returns directly to superior shell in a way which
	allows later continuation of ELLE.  Otherwise, asks "Quit?" and
	warns of modified buffers if any exist.  Responding "Y" and CR
	will then cause ELLE to exit permanently (no continuation possible).

<F132> Write File Exit
	Calls "Save All Files" and then exits (no continuation possible).

; 133-139 reserved

<F140> Hit Breakpoint
	This is a debugging function which calls the "bkpt"
	routine in ELLE, assuming that the user has set a
	debugging breakpoint there.  If no breakpoint has
	been set (by ADB or otherwise) then nothing happens.

<F141> Debug Mode
	With no argument, turns self-checking on and off.  When
	self-checking is on, the data structures will be verified
	after each top-level command.  (This may be quite slow).
	With an argument, invokes ELLE's debug/diagnostic mode, which
	has the prompt "D>".  Type "?" and CR for a list of subcommands.

; 142-149 reserved

IMAGEN-specific functions.  These can only exist in the IMAGEN configuration
of ELLE.

<F150> Execute Unix Command
	An IMAGEN-specific function.

<F151> Execute Make
	An IMAGEN-specific function.

<F152> Find Next Error
	An IMAGEN-specific function.


ICONOGRAPHICS-dependent functions.  These will not be found in
anything other than the ICONOGRAPHICS configuration of ELLE.

<F153> ICO Extend Command
	An Iconographics-specific function.

<F154> ICO Typeset Funs
	An Iconographics-specific function.

<F155> ICO Spec Input Funs
	An Iconographics-specific function.


SUN-specific functions.
	These functions are used to handle text selection and stuffing
when using the mouse version of ELLE.

<F156> Stuff Selection
	Inserts the current mouse text selection into the buffer.

<F157> Select Region
	Makes the current region be the current mouse text selection.
