                            I.  INTRODUCTION


     WELCOME to the world of ELLE!


     ELLE is the name of the text editor program.  It stands for "ELLE
Looks Like EMACS".  EMACS is a very advanced text editor developed at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has spread to many places
using many different computer systems.  ELLE is not as powerful or as
friendly as the real EMACS, but we hope you will like it.


     ELLE is great for writing papers, reports, tables, and messages
that need to be perfect.  It is capable of inserting, deleting, and mov-
ing words or text anywhere you want.

                            II.  FIRST STEPS


     Here we explain a few things to help you understand ELLE, and show
you how easy it is to use.



A.  _M_E_A_N_I_N_G__O_F__T_H_E__W_O_R_D_S__"_T_E_X_T_"__A_N_D__"_F_I_L_E_"


     ELLE is a "text editor".  It allows you to "edit" (that is, change)
stuff that we call TEXT.  Text is made of CHARACTERS such as the letters
A to Z, the digits 0 to 9, and punctuation marks like :;"#().  Even
things like space and carriage return are characters.  A book is made of
text printed on paper, messages are made of text stored in the computer,
and this whole paragraph is a bunch of text.  Text is anything you see
printed in a book, except pictures.


     A computer "book" is called a FILE.  The computer is like a
library; it has many files, or "books", that you can read.  Every book
has a title, and every FILE has a FILENAME.  If you forget the name of a
file (or book), you will have a hard time asking the computer (or
librarian) to find it for you!


     Remember that a computer book is just a file of text, and ELLE is a
text editor.  This means that you can write your own "books" with ELLE!
It does not matter how big or how small they are; they can be one word
long, or they can have thousands and thousands of characters.  Because
you are the "author", you can name them anything you want.


     From now on, we will mostly use the words "file" and "filename".
But if you have trouble understanding those words, just remember that
the computer is a "library", a file is a "book", a filename is the
"title", and text (or characters) is "words" (or "letters").



B.  _T_H_E__C_O_M_M_A_N_D_S


     ELLE makes it very easy to write things.  Normally, anything that
you type to ELLE becomes part of what you are writing.  But how do you
tell ELLE to do something different, like correct a mistake?  You have
to type a COMMAND.  Commands are special characters that you almost
never want to appear in your writing, and we use these characters for
telling ELLE to do special things.

                                 - 2 -










     The "commands" in ELLE are given with the CONTROL (CTRL) or ESCAPE
(ESC) keys.  All CONTROL key commands require that you hold down the
CTRL key while you type a letter.  This is just like using the SHIFT
key.  For example, CTRL-B means to hold down the CTRL key while you hit
the "B" key on the keyboard.  All ESCAPE key commands require that you
hit the ESC key BEFORE you hit some other letter.  For example, ESC D
means to first hit the ESC key and then type "D".  The command letters
are shown in this manual as capital letters, but you do not have to
shift and make the letter a capital; just type the letter normally,
without using the SHIFT key.



C.  _T_H_E__"_C_U_R_S_O_R_"


     The CURSOR is the little "underline" on your screen that blinks and
moves around.  (Some terminals may have a little "block" instead of an
underline -- it is the same thing.)  It is important to remember that
you are always working where the cursor is located, and many of the com-
mands relate to the position of the cursor.  For example, when you are
writing something, your typing will always be put on top of the cursor.





D.  _M_A_K_I_N_G__Y_O_U_R__F_I_R_S_T__F_I_L_E


     Now you are ready to start using ELLE!  Let us make one file with
ELLE and you will see some of the things that can be done.


--  Log on.
--  Type "elle first" followed by hitting the RETURN key.



     "elle" is the command to start ELLE; "first" is the name of the
file that we want to write.  We could call it something else, but
because this is our first file, "first" is a nice name.


     You will see your screen go blank, and the following words appear
at the bottom of your screen:

        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) first: first


-- Now you may begin typing some text.  Type "Hello...  this is a test
sentence," or anything you like.



                                 - 3 -










     As you start typing some text, you will see the bottom of the
screen change to:

        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) first: first *



     When you get to the end of a line, just type hit the RETURN key and
continue typing whatever text you want on the next line.


     o If you make a mistake while typing, push the "DELETE" key, and
       the letter to the left of the cursor will disappear.

     o Hitting CTRL-D will delete the character the cursor is under.

     o If you wish to move backward, type CTRL-B until the cursor is
       where you want it.

     o If you wish to go forward, type CTRL-F until the cursor is where
       you want it.



     o (Deleting words or sentences is explained in Chapter III.)



-- After you have finished typing text and you are ready to save the file,
type: CTRL-X CTRL-S.  (Remember, hold down the CTRL key while you type "X".
Then keep holding it down while you type "S".)

You will see at the bottom of your screen:

        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) first: first *
        Writing...Written

     What you wrote on the screen has now been stored in the computer
"library".  You have just made your first file, and it has the filename
"first".  It will stay there as long as you want, even after you log out
or hang up.

-- To get out of ELLE, type CTRL-X CTRL-Z.  You will see at the
bottom of your screen:

        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) first: first
        Quit?

--  Type "y" (for "yes") and RETURN.  (If you change your mind
and want to continue editing, you can type "n" for "no")





                                 - 4 -










     You are now out of ELLE and can use your familiar again.  The next
time you give the command "elle first", you will see everything in
"first" that you saved from the last time.  You can change and save
things in "first" as many times as you like!



















































                                 - 5 -














                          III.  BASIC EDITING



A.  _G_E_T_T_I_N_G__I_N_T_O__E_L_L_E


     To start ELLE give the command:

        elle filename

"Filename" can be the name of an old file that you already have, like
"first", or a name for a new file you want to create.  A new filename
should be a short word; do not use more than 13 letters, and do not use
punctuation marks.


     If it is a new file name, the screen will go blank and you will see
the name of the file at the bottom of the screen.  You can now start
typing text.


     If it is an old file name, the screen will then be filled with the
text of the old file, and the name of the file will appear at the bottom
of the screen.  You can now start inserting and editing the text.



B.  _G_E_T_T_I_N_G__O_U_T__O_F__E_L_L_E


     When you want to finish an editing session, there are two things
you will usually want to do:

(1) Save your work by typing:

        CTRL-X CTRL-S

This will SAVE the file on the computer.  NOTE: You MUST do this if you want
the computer to remember what you changed.  If you do not do this,
the new "book" you have written will not be put away in the "library".

(2) Exit by typing:

        CTRL-X CTRL-Z

This tells ELLE that you wish to quit.  The computer will ask "Quit?" to
make sure you mean it.  You type "y" or "yes" (followed by RETURN) if
you really want to quit.  If you type anything else, you will be put
back into the text to continue editing.

                                 - 6 -










     Even if you forget to SAVE the file, you will get:

        Buffer filename contains changes - write out?

ELLE wants to be sure that you did not forget.  If you want to save your
changes, answer "y" for "yes". Answering yes means to have the file
written so that it is kept as you have changed it.  If you do not want
the changes, answer "n" for "no".  Answering no means to keep the file
as it was before you started ELLE.



C.  _B_A_S_I_C__E_D_I_T_I_N_G__C_O_M_M_A_N_D_S


     The following is a summary of the basic commands for ELLE.  Many of
the commands are made so that you can remember what the command does by
the first letter of the word.   For example, CTRL-K means to (K)ill
everything to the right of the cursor on that line.



     1.  _I_N_S_E_R_T_I_N_G


     All normal characters you type will be "inserted" where the cursor
is.  If there is already a character where the cursor is, that character
(and everything else on the line) will be moved over to make room for
the new character.


     When your words get near the right edge of the screen, you should
hit the RETURN key and start a new line.  If the line becomes longer
than the video display allows, a "!" mark shows there is more on one
line than will print on an 8 1/2 inch sheet of paper.  The extra text
that you would normally not see on the 8 1/2 inch sheet will be contin-
ued on the next line; that is, ELLE will show you what has "gone off the
edge", but you must remember that the words will go off the paper if you
try to print them on an 8 1/2 inch sheet of paper.  You may go to some
word before the "!" mark and hit the RETURN key to get rid of the "!"
mark.  (If you have a very long line with "!" marks on several consecu-
tive lines, you may have to do this procedure several times.)

See Chapter V on "filling text" for a way to remove the "!" mark.











                                 - 7 -










     2.  _M_O_V_I_N_G__T_H_E__C_U_R_S_O_R

    CTRL-F    FORWARD one character
    CTRL-B    BACKWARD one character

    ESC F     FORWARD one word
    ESC B     BACKWARD one word

    CTRL-E    END of current line
    CTRL-A    Beginning of current line (Well, "A" begins the alphabet)

    CTRL-N    NEXT line (goes forward to next line)
    CTRL-P    PREVIOUS line (goes backward to previous line)

    CTRL-V    go forward to beginning of next screenful
    ESC V     go backward to beginning of previous screenful

    ESC <     go to beginning of whole file
    ESC >     go to end of whole file

    ESC [     forward a paragraph
    ESC ]     backward a paragraph



     Moving the cursor will never delete or insert any characters.



     3.  _D_E_L_E_T_I_N_G

    CTRL-D      DELETES the one character the cursor is under
    DELETE      DELETES the one character to the left of cursor

    ESC D       Kills forward one word from the cursor
    ESC DELETE  Kills backward one word from the cursor
    CTRL-K      KILLS rest of the line (to the right of the cursor)
                If there is nothing there, the following lines move up.




     4.  _C_H_A_N_G_I_N_G__Y_O_U_R__M_I_N_D


     If you make a mistake and delete something by accident, you may get
back the most recent deletion(s) by using:

        CTRL-Y

This means YANK back (bring back) what was most recently deleted. It
will be inserted at the cursor.  Note:  Single character deletes (CTRL-D
and DELETE) are not saved.  Only deletes of words or lines are saved.


                                 - 8 -










     5.  _I_F__T_H_E__S_C_R_E_E_N__G_E_T_S__M_E_S_S_E_D__U_P


     If you get noise on the phone line or if someone links to you while
you are in ELLE, you will need to clear the screen of the new, unwanted
characters.  To make the screen show what you are really editing, type:

        CTRL-L

ELLE will clear the screen and recreate the picture.













































                                 - 9 -














                         IV.  ADVANCED EDITING


     In this section we will be talking about some of the more sophisti-
cated uses of ELLE.



A.  _C_A_S_E__C_H_A_N_G_I_N_G


     Here are some handy little commands to make words uppercase and
lowercase, if they are not the way you want them.

ESC L   Lowercase word.  The first word to the right is changed to
        lower case.  If the cursor is in the middle of a word,
        only the part to the right will be changed.

ESC U   Uppercase word.  Just like ESC L, except it changes letters
        of the word to upper case.

ESC C   Capitalize word.  Just like ESC L, except the first letter
        that is changed will become upper case.  The others will become
        lower case.




B.  _C_O_M_M_A_N_D_S__D_O_N_E__A__S_P_E_C_I_F_I_C__N_U_M_B_E_R__O_F__T_I_M_E_S


     You may give a specific number of times you wish a specific command
to be done.  For instance, you may go forward six words or backwards
nine lines.  To define how many times you wish the next command to be
done give the command:



        ESC number

     In place of the word "number" you type a number that you wish.  You
then give the command that you want.









                                - 10 -











Examples:

To move ahead three lines --
                           ESC 3 CTRL-N

To delete the next ten characters --
                           ESC 10 CTRL-D

To move ahead two screens --
                           ESC 2 CTRL-V




C.  _F_O_U_R__W_O_R_D_S_,__L_I_N_E_S_,__C_H_A_R_A_C_T_E_R_S__E_T_C_.


     There is a special command that will let you do the commands we
have learned so far, but in multiples of four.  This is:

        CTRL-U



     You type this before the command that you want to do four times.
For example:


Delete the next four letters --
                           CTRL-U CTRL-D

Move forward four lines --
                           CTRL-U CTRL-N

Move four words ahead --
                           CTRL-U ESC F



     If you do CTRL-U CTRL-U , then a command, the command will happen
16 TIMES !!   So be careful of the number of CTRL-U's that you do.


     Once you get used to using ELLE, this is faster for moving around
generally than trying to set a specific number of times for a command.



D.  _T_R_A_N_S_P_O_S_I_N_G__C_H_A_R_A_C_T_E_R_S__A_N_D__W_O_R_D_S





                                - 11 -










     Transpose means to switch or exchange.  If you transpose the
letters "pn" you get the letters "np".  Many times we type fast and
misspell a word by transposing letters.  You can switch the letters by
using:

        CTRL-T

To do this, just put the cursor under the second letter that is placed
wrong, and hit CTRL-T.


     To transpose words use put the cursor on the second word of the two
words that you want transposed and use:

        ESC T




E.  _F_I_L_L_I_N_G__T_E_X_T

[ When you look at this section
you see that the
words
do not fill in
on the screen.  If you edit
a lot, you may
get paragraphs that look a little bit "rough".]



     To fill in the paragraph use the command:

        ESC Q



     You may put the cursor anywhere in the paragraph and the whole
paragraph will be adjusted.  This is how the paragraph looks after the
ESC Q is done:

[ When you look at this section you see that the words do not fill in
on the screen.  If you edit a lot, you may get paragraphs that look a
little bit "rough".]



     The paragraph is filled in to look like a normal paragraph. It is
important to remember that a paragraph starts from an indented line and
ends just before a new line that also has indentation.





                                - 12 -











  In these two paragraphs,
two of the sentences are indented.
The indentation
shows that a new paragraph begins.
  If the cursor was put anywhere in one of the four
lines above, only the two sentences before this one would
be filled.  That is because the sentence beginning with
"If the cursor..." is indented, and is the beginning of a
new paragraph.



     This command is very good when you see the "!" mark showing that
there are too many characters to print on an 8 1/2 inch piece of paper.
Just put the cursor at the beginning of the sentence where the "!" mark
appears, and the line (and the whole paragraph it is in) will be filled
so that the "!" will disappear.


     Example:

                         -----------------------
                        |  The text in this scr!|
                        |een will overflow.  Th!|
                        |e "!" mark shows that !|
                        |the lines need to be f!|
                        |illed.                 |
                        |                       |
                         -----------------------

The above screen shows that the lines must be fixed so that you can fit
the whole text on an 8 /12 inch page.  Putting the cursor somewhere near
the beginning of the sentence and hitting ESC Q will remove all the "!"
marks and put in carriage returns where necessary.  Below is how the
text might look if the cursor was put anywhere in the paragraph above
and then hitting ESC Q.

                         -----------------------
                        |  The text in this     |
                        |screen will overflow.  |
                        |The "!" mark shows     |
                        |that the lines need    |
                        |to be filled.          |
                        |                       |
                         -----------------------




F.  _S_E_T_T_I_N_G__L_I_N_E__L_E_N_G_T_H




                                - 13 -










     If you use the ESC Q command to fill without using this command,
the text will be justified to 71 characters.


     To set a special line length you should type:

        ESC number

where "number" is where you type the number of characters that you want
to have on one line.  Immediately type:

        CTRL-X F

You will see at the bottom of your screen:

        Fill column =

followed by the number that you gave as the line length with the "ESC
number" command.


     This same procedure may be done a bit differently.  You may put the
cursor in any column that you wish on the screen, and giving the "CTRL-X
F" command will set the line length to width that the cursor is at.
This does not fill the paragraph; it only sets the line length for when
you give the command ESC Q.  To adjust your paragraphs to the length you
set, you must use the ESC Q.



G.  _S_E_A_R_C_H_I_N_G


     Sometimes you know what you are looking for in a file, but it takes
a long time to move there with CTRL-N or CTRL-V.  There is a much faster
way to do this, which is good for other things too.  When you type the
SEARCH command CTRL-S, you will see at the bottom of the screen:

        Search:

ELLE is asking you for a STRING to search for.  A string is just a small
piece of text.  The letters "refab" are a string, for example.  Just
type in some letters, and end the string with a RETURN.  ELLE will then
look through the text to find the string and go to the first occurence
of that string.  If you were looking for the word "Deafnet", you would
hit CTRL-S and then type in those letters.  ELLE would go to the first
place where the word Deafnet appeared.


     It helps to not search for a string that is too short.  For exam-
ple, you can ask ELLE to search for the string "he".  ELLE will start
from where the cursor is and stop as soon as it finds anything with
those letters in it; the words "here", "there", "she", and "father" all
have the string "he" in them, and the cursor will stop at any one of

                                - 14 -










those places if the word "he" is searched for.  If ELLE cannot find any-
thing that matches what you typed, you will see at the bottom:

        Search failed

You have to be sure that you type the string in the right case.  This
means that you must be sure that you have your capital letters typed
exactly as in the word you are searching for.  "He" will not match the
"he" in "There", but it will match the "He" in "Here".


     If you want to search again for other occurences of the same
string, just type CTRL-S again and then a RETURN.  ELLE will understand
that you want to look for the same string as last time.  If you want to
search backwards instead, use the command CTRL-R for "Reverse search".
It works exactly like CTRL-S except for the direction that it searches
in.



H.  _U_S_E__T_H_E__"_M_A_R_K_"__T_O__M_A_K_E__A__"_R_E_G_I_O_N_"


     The MARK is like an "invisible cursor" that stays where you set it.
Sometimes you will want to delete or move a lot of text at once.  You
can do this by setting the mark at one end of the stuff you want to
delete and by moving the cursor to the other end; everything between the
mark and the cursor is called a REGION.


     To set the mark, type CTRL-@ when the cursor is where you want the
mark to be.  You cannot see the mark, but ELLE will remember where it
is.  It does not hurt to type CTRL-@ several times, but there is only
one mark, and ELLE only remembers where you last set it.


     If you want to make sure you know where the mark is, type CTRL-X
CTRL-X.  This will exchange the cursor and the mark; the cursor will
move to where the mark was set, and the mark will be reset to the place
the cursor was at.  Just type CTRL-X CTRL-X again to get back to the
place you were at.  This is handy when you want to move somewhere else
briefly, but come back to the same place.  Just set the mark, wander
around, and then type CTRL-X CTRL-X to get back to your starting place.


     To delete the region between the mark and the cursor, type CTRL-W
(for Wipe-out).  All the text in the region will disappear.  Of course,
typing CTRL-Y (for Yank-back) will bring back all the deleted text.


     This makes it very easy to move whole paragraphs of text.  Just
mark the beginning of the paragraph and then move the cursor to the end
of the paragraph and wipe out that section (CTRL-Y).  Then move the cur-
sor to the place that you wish to have the paragraph put; hit the CTRL-Y

                                - 15 -










and all the text comes back.  To make a copy of a region, which you can
put somewhere else with CTRL-Y, use ESC W.



I.  _T_H_E__"_K_I_L_L__R_I_N_G_"


     By now you know that CTRL-Y will "yank back" the text you most
recently deleted (or copied with ESC W).  But sometimes this is not what
you want; you would like to get back things that were deleted before the
most recent stuff.  ESC Y lets you do this!  ELLE keeps a KILL RING of
deleted and copied text; any time you kill something, it is saved on the
"ring".  It is called a ring because there is only room for 8 saved
things, and if you try to save a 9th thing, the first thing will have to
be kicked out.  So you can only save the 8 most recent things that you
deleted or copied.


     To use ESC Y, you must first use CTRL-Y.  If the text that is
yanked back is not the stuff that you want, you can then type ESC Y.
ELLE will then try to use the next most recent stuff from the kill ring.
You can keep typing ESC Y as many times as you want, but after 8 times
you will notice that the same things are being yanked back, and you have
seen everything that was saved on the ring.  (Neither CTRL-Y nor ESC Y
removes anything from the ring.) Remember that you cannot use ESC Y
except right after CTRL-Y or another ESC Y.

         ------------



     A BUFFER in ELLE is like a temporary "book".  When you are working
on a file (a computer "book"), ELLE does not "check out" the book from
the computer library; ELLE makes a copy, and this temporary copy is
called a BUFFER.  This lets you work on your own copy, without bothering
other people who might want to read the same file.

                                - 16 -

        |            |
        |            |
         ------------



     Nothing that you do with the temporary copy will have any effect,
unless you ask ELLE to "save" or "write out" the buffer.  In the above
example, the word "there" will not appear in the original file unless
the buffer is saved.  The files or "books" always stay in the computer
"library"; you cannot work on them there, but ELLE is like a "desk"
where you can do anything you want with your copies of those books.  A
buffer does not have to have something in it; if you were writing a new
"book", you would start with an empty buffer.


     It is very important to understand this idea.  If you do not know
what a "buffer" is, you will be confused when you try to use the best
features of ELLE.


     ELLE will let you have many different buffers, all at the same
time.  To tell them apart, each buffer must have a BUFFER NAME.  This
can be anything you want, but two buffers cannot have the same name.  If
a buffer is holding a "temporary copy" of a file, the buffer will also
have a SOURCE FILENAME.  This tells you where the copy came from, and
where your changes will go if you save them back in the computer
"library".


     This sounds complicated, but ELLE tries to show you what is going
on.  Remember the line at the bottom of the screen?  Let's look at it
again:

Example:


        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) draft: mail/draft
                                ^       ^
                                |       |
                              buffer   source
                              name     filename



                                - 17 -










     The screen will always show a buffer, and ELLE will always tell you
what buffer it is.  (It is impossible to have no buffer at all).  If the
contents of the buffer came from a file "book" in the "library", ELLE
will also show you the source filename, so that you know where the text
came from.  This also tells you where the text will be saved when you
type CTRL-X CTRL-S to put your new "book" into the "library".


     If you start ELLE without giving a filename, you will see at the
bottom of the screen:

        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) Main:

It is impossible to not have any buffers, because ELLE will make one for
you if necessary, and will name it "Main".


     As soon as you start typing something you will see this at the bot-
tom of your screen.

        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) Main: *

The character "*" shows that you have modified or changed the contents
of the buffer.


     After you have typed a lot of text, you will see on the right of
the * something like:

ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) Main: * --50%--
                                  ^
                                  |
This number means that the top line on the screen is 50% (or half-way)
through the full file.  In other words, you are in the middle of the
file.  If you are at the beginning of the file you will see   --TOP--.
If you are at the bottom of the file you will see:   --BOT--.




K.  _C_R_E_A_T_I_N_G__B_U_F_F_E_R_S


     There are two ways to create a buffer.  One is the "buffer select"
command, and the other is the "find file" command.  When you type the
"buffer select" command,

        CTRL-X B

at the bottom of your screen, you will see:

        Select buffer:

Here you give the buffer a name.  It can be whatever you wish, but

                                - 18 -










should be less than 13 characters long, without any spaces.  Hit the
RETURN key when you are finished with the buffer name.  You may use
names that are easy like "a", "b", "1","2", etc.  Or you may use names
that help you remember what you are doing like "letter.sam".


     If there is not already a buffer with this name, ELLE will create
an empty buffer with the name you have given it.  You will also see at
the bottom of the screen the name of the buffer:

ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) buffername:
                                     ^
                                     |
        Notice that there is no source filename here (after
        the buffer name).  The buffer will be empty.


Remember: A buffer is a TEMPORARY "book" in the editor.  You can start
it from nothing; you do not have to start it with a "copy" of a file
from the "library".


     The other way to create a buffer is the "find file" command, and
this is how you start it with a "copy".  This command is:

        CTRL-X CTRL-F

At the bottom of the screen you will see:

        Find file:

Then you type a filename and RETURN.  Remember how you use the command
"elle filename" to start ELLE?  "Find file" does exactly the same
things.  First ELLE makes a buffer for you which uses the last part of
the filename for the buffer name.  Then, if the filename is already in
the computer "library", ELLE will make a temporary copy for you and put
it in the buffer.  The source filename will be exactly what you typed,
and will remind you of where the copy came from.  Even if the filename
is not in the "library", ELLE will set the source filename anyway,
guessing that you will want to make a new file with that name.

     ELLE lets you have several buffers at the same time, but usually
you are only working on one of them at a time.  (See Sections O. and P.
about "Windows" to learn how to see two buffers at once.) In order to
move from one buffer to another, you must use the "select buffer" com-
mand.  That's right, CTRL-X B is used both to make new buffers and to
move to buffers you already have.  When you type a buffer name in
response to the "Select buffer:" question, ELLE looks to see if there is
already a buffer with that name.  If there is one, you are moved there,

                                - 19 -










and the cursor is put at the same place that you originally left it.  If
there is no buffer with that name, ELLE will make a new one.  If you
happen to forget the name of a buffer, that is ok, because ELLE will
remember the names of the buffers you have made.


     To get a list of the buffers you have already used type:

        CTRL-X CTRL-B

NOTE:  That is CTRL-X and CTRL-B; NOT the command to find a buffer.

     1.  _R_E_A_D__F_I_L_E


     Remember that when ELLE "gets a file", it is really making a tem-
porary copy and putting that copy into a buffer.  There are three dif-
ferent ways to do this.  One of them is "find file", which you have
already seen.  Usually this is the easiest thing to do because it does a
lot of the work for you.  The most similar command is "read file", which
is:

        CTRL-X CTRL-R

At the bottom of your screen you will see:

        Read file:

Here you give the name of the file that you wish to edit.  Example:
Suppose that you have a buffer named "contract".  You wish to work on a
file named "check".  You may "read in" the file with the CTRL-X CTRL-R.
After reading in the file called "check" you will see:

        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) contract: check

What you have done is put the file named "check" into the buffer named
"contract".  If you give a file name that does not exist, you will get
the error message:

        Cannot open input file !

The "read file" command is useful if you know that you want to read an
old file, or if you already have a buffer and want to use that same
buffer to edit the file with.  The command will not change the buffer
name, but it will set the source filename, so that saving the buffer
with CTRL-X CTRL-S will write the copy back to the place it came from.



                                - 20 -










     WARNING: when you do a "read file" command, any new information
that you have put in the current buffer will be lost.



     2.  _I_N_S_E_R_T__F_I_L_E


     The last way of getting text from a file into a buffer is to use
the "insert file" command:

        CTRL-X CTRL-I

which means to INSERT a file.  At the bottom of your screen you will
see:

        Insert file:

Here you give the filename for the text you want to insert, and end with
a RETURN.  A copy of the text from the file you specify will be put
where the cursor is, sort of like a big "yank".  This command does not
throw away the previous contents of the buffer (like "read file"), and
it does not change the buffer name or the source filename.



N.  _S_A_V_I_N_G__O_R__W_R_I_T_I_N_G__O_U_T__A__B_U_F_F_E_R


     When you are done working on a buffer, or just want to stop for
awhile, you should "put back" your temporary "book" into the computer
"library".  If you do not do this before you get out of ELLE, your
changes will not be saved.  There are three ways to do this.  The easi-
est one, which you have been using up to now, is "save file", or CTRL-X
CTRL-S.  This is fine if your buffer has a source filename, and you want
to store your text using that filename.


     But if your buffer does NOT have a source filename, you cannot use
"save file", because it will not know what name you want to use.  Or
maybe the buffer does have a source filename, but you do not want to
save your "book" with that name.  For both of these cases you can use
"write file":

        CTRL-X CTRL-W

You will see at the bottom of your screen:

        Write File:

You can now type in the name that you wish to give to the new file and
end it with a RETURN.  Names should not be longer than 13 letters, and
should not have punctuation marks or spaces.  This will create the file
with the name that you have given.  You will see this at the bottom of

                                - 21 -










the screen:

        Writing...Written

When you use "write file" you will also set the buffer's source
filename, even if it was already set.  Example:  Let us assume that you
have a buffer named "1".  After writing the file called "todo" you will
see...

        ELLE 2.6e (Fundamental) 1: todo



     After you have saved your buffer with "save file" or "write file"
you can exit ELLE if you want, but you do not have to.  You can stay in
ELLE and keep editing as long as you want.  You can make more changes to
the same buffer, or select a new buffer to work on, or read in text from
a different file, or anything you like.


     The last way to write out a file is with the "write region" com-
mand.  This is CTRL-X CTRL-E and acts just like the "write file" com-
mand, but it does not change the source filename of the buffer, because
you probably wrote out only a small part of the buffer.



O.  _T_W_O__W_I_N_D_O_W__D_I_S_P_L_A_Y


     Two window display can be helpful in several ways.  If you have a
large file and you wish to compare information in two different sections
of that file, splitting the display into 2 windows will allow easy com-
parison.  When you first make two windows, the screen will be split in
half horizontally, and the same file will be shown in both halves.  The
command for making two windows is:

        CTRL-X 2

You may move between the two windows by using the command to go to the
OTHER window:

        CTRL-X O

Your cursor will go to the window at the place where you last left off.
REMEMBER: When you make the second window, you have the SAME buffer (and
file) in BOTH windows.


     If you are working on one screen, you will not see the changes hap-
pen until you do the CTRL-X O command; then the changes will happen in
that window also.



                                - 22 -










     If you would like your current window to be a little bigger:

        CTRL-X G

will "grow" the window you are in.


     If you want to use just one window again so that the whole screen
can be used to show the buffer:

        CTRL-X 1

This makes one window.  Use this when you have two windows and you want
only one of them.  Put the cursor in the window that you want to expand,
then do the command.  The other window will disappear.  If you had a
separate buffer in the window that disappeared, it is still accessible
with the CTRL-X B command.



P.  _W_O_R_K_I_N_G__W_I_T_H__T_W_O__W_I_N_D_O_W_S__-_-__T_W_O__F_I_L_E_S


     Another reason for working with two windows is to allow you to move
information in one file into another file very easily.  You may create a
buffer in one window and keep the original buffer in the other window.
Once you have two separate buffers, you can read a different file into
each one.


     IMPORTANT:  With two windows, you MUST create a new buffer before
reading another file into the second window.  Therefore, if you are
going to work with two separate files in two windows, you should do one
of the following commands (to make sure the buffer is set up):

        CTRL-X CTRL-F
           ^
           |
        This creates a buffer and FINDS the file for it.


        CTRL-X B
           ^
           |
        This creates a blank buffer.



     To copy some text from one window to the other:






                                - 23 -











1)  Delete the words, sentences or area that you wish to transfer.
    You can also use the ESC W command to copy a region.
2)  Do CTRL-Y to put all that information just deleted back where you
    found it.  (You don't need this if you used ESC W.)
3)  Do CTRL-X O to move to the other window.
4)  Move the cursor to where you want the "copied" information put.
5)  Do another CTRL-Y to get back the information that you want.




Q.  _Q_U_E_R_Y__R_E_P_L_A_C_E


     ESC %


     Give the ESC % command and you will see at the bottom of the screen
"Replace string:".  Here you give a string that you wish to have
replaced followed by a carriage return. Next you will see the words
"with string:" and you type the new string you wish to have inserted.
ELLE will then forward search and go to the first occurence of the
string that you wish to replace.  You will also see (Query Replace) at
the bottom of the screen instead of (Fundamental).  If you do not
remember the choices, you may type "?" and you will be prompted with
what can be done.

        - Hitting the SPACE BAR at each point in the file will cause
        that occurance of the string to be replaced with whatever you
        typed after the "with string:" prompt.  ELLE will then go to the
        next occurence of the string you wished replaced.

        - Hitting the DELETE key will tell ELLE to not do the
        replacement on this string (and will go to the next occurance).

        - Hitting the ESCAPE key will indicate that you wish to stop the
        process of query replace.

        - If you are sure that you wish all occurances of the string to be
        replaced, you may hit the "!" key and ALL occurances of that string
        will be replaced by what ever you stated.  You should be careful
        that you are not replacing a string that might occur in some other
        word.  Example:  Replacing all occurances of "and" with "but" will
        make the word "band" become "bbut" and the word "bland", "blbut".
        Worse would be replacing all "nation"s with "country".  That would
        make "SRI International" become "SRI Intercountryal".  Be careful.

        -You may go back one previous occurance of the string by hitting
        the "^" key.  You may then decide to replace the string if you wish.
        ELLE will put the string that you wished to be "query replaced"
        into the search buffer so you may later search or reverse search
        for the same string if you wish.

CTRL-X CTRL-F
     Find a file.  If the filename is already associated with
     a buffer, this acts like a "buffer select" to that buffer.
     Otherwise, a new buffer is created and associated with this
     filename.  If the file exists, a copy is made, otherwise
     the buffer is left empty.  The source filename is set to
     the filename you typed.


CTRL-X CTRL-S
     Save the file.  This step is important to keep information for a
     later time.  If there is a source filename, the text in the buffer
     (including all your changes) will be stored under that filename.
     If there is no source filename, ELLE will complain with
     this error message:    No default file name.
     This means you must write to a file (CTRL-X CTRL-W) first
     and give a file name.


CTRL-X CTRL-I
     Insert a file.  This will copy file that you name into the buffer
     you are working on.  This does nothing to the name of the buffer
     you are working in or the source filename for the buffer.


CTRL-X CTRL-R
     Read a file.  This will copy a file into the buffer you are
     working in.  The buffer name will stay the same but the
     source filename will change.  Note: if you do not save the
     changes you made in the buffer before you "Read in" the
     new text, then those changes are lost.


CTRL-X CTRL-W
     Write a file.  You will be asked to give a name for the file.  When
     you give the filename, the file will be created for you.  The
     buffer name will not change, but the source filename will
     be set to the filename you typed.


CTRL-X CTRL-E
     Just like CTRL-X CTRL-W, except that it writes out the
     current region instead of the whole file.

CTRL-O
     This "opens up" lines.  It is just like RETURN, except that the
     cursor does not move.  If you are typing many lines, it is
     often more efficient to first open up some blank lines with

                                - 25 -










     CTRL-O before you start typing, since ELLE will not have to move
     things around so much while you type.

CTRL-X CTRL-O
     Deletes blank lines that surround the cursor.  This is
     handy for use with CTRL-O; you first "open up" a lot
     of lines, type in some text, and then give CTRL-X CTRL-O
     to get rid of all the blank lines that you don't need.

ESC-\
     Deletes spaces that surround the cursor.

CTRL-T
     Transposes the previous character with the one the cursor is on.

ESC T
     Transposes the previous word with the one the cursor is at.

CTRL-U
     This will make the next command happen four times.  This will
     work for many, but not all, commands.
     For example: CTRL-U ESC D will delete the next four words.

CTRL-U CTRL-L
     The EXCEPTION to the "next command happen four times" rule.  This
     will refresh only the line the cursor is on.  This is especially
     helpful on 300 baud terminals when you wish to clean up only one
     line and not refresh the whole screen because it would take too
     long.

ESC number CTRL-L
     This adjusts the text on the screen by moving the cursor "number"
     of lines away from the top of the screen.  The cursor will not
     change its position within the text.  Thus, the command
     "ESC 0 CTRL-L" will put the cursor at the top left of the screen.
     Anything before the cursor will not be seen, so if you wish to
     use this command to position full text on the screen at a certain
     place, it would be good to put the cursor at the beginning of the
     line.

CTRL-Q
     "Quotes" the next character literally, even if it is normally
     an ELLE   command.  The character immediately after this command
     will always be inserted into the text of your file.  This is
     useful for things like ^L which is a "page break" when sent to a
     printer. If this feature was not here, then ELLE would refresh the
     screen every time that you wanted to insert a "page break".

ESC Q
     Fill the text in this paragraph.  It is important to know that
     a paragraph is defined as the text between two indented (or
     blank) lines.

CTRL-X F
     Set the line length for filling a paragraph; you may give the length
     by typing ESC followed by the number you wish the length to be.
     ESC Q will use this line length when filling.  Example:
     "ESC 55 CTRL-X F" would set the line length for filling a paragraph
     at 55 characters.  You may also put the cursor in the column you
     wish to set the length, and this command will set the line length
     to that width.


CTRL-X !
     If you wish to do some command (e.g. look at
     who is on the system or to get a list of your file names) you can
     temporarily leave ELLE and come back to where you are editing later
     on.  To get back to your original editing session at the same place
     you left it,
EOF character (often CTRL-D).
