			ELLE COMMAND SUMMARY

     This is a complete summary of all ELLE commands as of ELLE 4.0.
They are grouped according to function.  For detailed explanations of
each command, see the manual or the help for that command.
	The keyboard characters typed to invoke a command are shown as
"CTRL-x" to indicate a control character, "ESC" to indicate ESCAPE (or
ALTMODE), or simply "x" to indicate that character.  It is possible
for an installation or user to define a different mapping for the
keys; the ones shown assume the default mapping.

                and the rest becomes lowercase.

ESC U           Makes the whole next word uppercase.

---- SEARCHING

CTRL-S		Incremental Search forward; prompts "I-search:"
CTRL-R		Reverse Incremental Search; prompts "R-search:"
	During an incremental search, the following characters
	have special effects:
		"normal" chars	- Begin searching immediately.
		^G		- Cancel I-search, return to start.
		DEL		- Erase last char, return to last match.
		^S, ^R		- Repeat search (or change direction).
				If string empty, uses previous search string.
		ESC or CR	- Exit I-search at current point.
			If string empty, turns into String Search, which
			prompts "Search:" or "Reverse Search:" and waits
			for a complete string to be typed.
			A CR or ESC ends the string and starts the search.

ESC %           Query Replace.  Asks for a search string, then
			for the replacement string, and begins searching.
			Stops at each match and waits for a command.
			Type "?" to see your options.
CTRL-X %	Replace String.  Like Query Replace, but simply
			replaces all matches, without stopping to ask.

(If you don't give a string, ELLE will use the string you gave
 in the previous search.)

                lines of text, or a whole section of text as a region.
