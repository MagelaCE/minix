ABOUT ELLE

	"ELLE" stands for "ELLE Looks Like EMACS".  By EMACS is meant,
of course, the original TECO-based EMACS on the MIT ITS PDP-10 systems,
largely the work of Richard Stallman.  All other programs calling
themselves "EMACS" are at best clones and at worst misleading
counterfeits which should be known by other names; ELLE is nowhere as
good as EMACS, but is honest about its masquerade.

	ELLE's ancient ancestor was TORES (Text ORiented Editing
System) written in January 1979 by Jeff Schiller (MIT).  This was
hacked further by Dan Weinreb (while at LLL), and then extensively in
March 1980 by Mike Kraley (BBN).  Ken Harrenstien (SRI) picked up TORES
for use in developing the SRI Deafnet system on an old PDP-11/40, where
the limitations of TORES and the 11/40 address space finally forced a
complete redesign by October 1981, and the new program was christened
ELLE.

	ELLE's purpose in life is to provide basic EMACS-like editing
for small 16-bit machines.  It does not try to be anything more than
this, and is not intended to compete with editors developed for more
powerful 32-bit systems, although it can certainly be used on them.

	This file ("elle.doc") contains the essential information needed
to build and run ELLE.  Other sources of information are:
	"00read.me"	- distribution policy & notes
	"chnges.doc"	- a list of recent changes
	"cmdsum.doc"	- a simple user command summary
	"manual.doc"	- naive user tutorial (old)
	"gnumax.doc"	- information about GNU Emacs
	TECO EMACS manual - see below

	"manual.doc" is a large (about 50 pages) document which was
intended to allow very naive users to start using ELLE; it was written
for DEAFNET and SRI-TSC users, and includes a command summary and much
explanation of how to use the editor.  This manual is quite old and
somewhat outdated, but is included just in case it turns out to be
of use elsewhere.

	"gnumax.doc" is a copy of the GNU Emacs DISTRIB file.  It
explains how to obtain the documentation for GNU Emacs, which can be
considered the rightful successor to TECO EMACS.  Because ELLE is
modelled after EMACS, much of this manual is useful even though ELLE
only supports a fraction of the commands described therein; people who
have a technical background but no previous experience with EMACS will
find that it explains many mysteries.  Also, users who have large
enough machines may wish to obtain the source and use the real thing
instead.

	Prior to the GNU Emacs manual, the major reference work was
a hardcopy document describing TECO EMACS, "MIT AI Memo 555: EMACS
Manual for TWENEX Users", written by Richard M. Stallman.  It may

INSIDE ELLE - Features and Non-features

	Many editors (including the old TORES) structure a buffer as a
linked list of lines, some of which may be swapped out to disk.  ELLE is
built around a completely different mechanism for handling buffers, the
SB (String-Buffer) package.  Conceptually each buffer looks just like
an EMACS buffer, i.e.  a single amorphous mass of characters.  (Note
that the UNIX file system presents the same concept, as files are
considered to be continuous streams of bytes.) Internally, a buffer is
a linked list of characters wherein the chunk divisions are made
without regard to the logical meaning of the character text; chunks are
created or split only as needed for ease of modification, swapping, or
garbage collecting.  ELLE can be used to read binary files as well as
text files, since line lengths are irrelevant except for display
purposes.

	ELLE can handle two windows and many buffers (the exact number
depends on storage compaction efficiency), with files of up to 2**31
bytes in length (that is, as large a file as "lseek" will handle).  The
only difference between small and large files is that small files are
more apt to fit entirely within memory and thus processing will be
faster.

	Normally ELLE is not able to read the entire file into memory
and must leave some of it "swapped out" on disk; unlike some editors
which copy the entire file to a temporary location, ELLE retains an
open file descriptor to the original file and whenever possible swaps
in new text from this original.  This considerably reduces the startup
time, so that it is very convenient to use ELLE for casual reading.
This does imply, however, that if any modifications are made "in place"
to that same file by some other program while ELLE is reading it,
confusion is apt to result.  However, such in-place modification (other
than appending) is a bad practice for a number of reasons and good
software will avoid doing this.
	ELLE, for example, never writes over an existing file when
making updates; it writes out the complete new file to a temporary
name, renames the old file to a backup name, and then renames the new file
to the desired final name.

MAKING ELLE - Putting it all together

The following steps should lead you through.  Note that for the most
common case (standard V7-type Unix) there is very little you have to do.

[1] DO YOU HAVE "MAKE"?
	If you have the "make" program, skip this and go to the next step!

	For V6 systems, which normally do not have "make", you
	will need to use the V6 shell runfiles, listed below for reference:

	v6init.sh	- Initial once-over to establish library order
	v6cc.sh		- Per-module compilation
	v6load.sh	- Build ELLE from library
	sbv6mk.sh	- Compile SB library

	If you have neither "make" nor a V6 system, you will have to
	look at the runfiles and muddle along by hand.  TOPS-20 systems
	are provided with two .MIC files.

[2] CHECK THE "SB" SETUP
	Normally you should not need to do anything about compile-time
	switches or settings for the SB library package.
	There is only one exception.

	IF you are on a PDP-11 system, AND using "make",
	THEN edit "sbmake":
		(1) Change BCOPYSUF from ".c" to ".s".
		(2) If your system is V6, add "-DV6" to the CFLAGS definition.

	Note that if not using "make", the runfile "sbv6mk.sh" is already
	set up to assume PDP-11 and V6.

	Explanation for the curious:
		The V6 compile-time switch is the only essential thing
	needed by the SB package.  However, since much of ELLE's work
	involves moving strings around, the Makefile attempts to optimize
	the string-moving routine ("bcopy").  This is part of the standard
	library for BSD systems and is normally written in assembler.
		The file "bcopy.s" is a PDP-11 assembler version and is
	preferable on all PDP-11 systems since it is more efficient than
	both the C version and the 2.9BSD assembler version.  PDP-11 users
	may wish to install it in their C library.
		If the Makefile determines that your system's library does
	not furnish "bcopy", it will substitute its own version, in C.

	Additional notes:
		The SB package contains some machine-dependent definitions
	which normally do NOT need to be changed; they are known to work for
	all of the following machines:

	DEC PDP-11, DEC VAX-11, DEC PDP-10 (!), Zilog Z8000,
	Motorola MC68000, Intel 8086 (IBM-PC), HP-9000, Pyramid

	Problems should only arise if your machine is VERY unusual.  If you
	really think this is the case, get in touch with the ELLE maintainer
	and meanwhile check the macros and typedefs in sb.h.


[3] THE FUN STARTS HERE - EESITE.H
	Now look at the file "eesite.h" which is where you should set
	all of the compile-time switches and parameters for your version of
	ELLE.  The following substeps attempt to cover the important ones.

(3.1) V6:
	The V6 switch should be defined as 1 only if you are using a V6
system.  Otherwise, leave it set to zero.

(3.2) System:
	Only one system should be selected (one of UCB, BSD4_2, SUN,
BBN, DNTTY, ONYX, COHERENT, VENIX86, PCIX, APOLLO, HPUX, SYSV, TOPS20),
whichever is most specific.  If your system does not correspond to any
of these, leave them all set to zero; the default assumes you have a
"vanilla" V7 UNIX.
	However, in the latter case, you should examine the file
"eesite.c" and attempt to provide your own code for the function
ts_inp(), if at all possible.  It is worth hacking your kernel if you
can do so!  Otherwise redisplay will be somewhat more repetitious and
annoying.
	The ICONOGRAPHICS configuration definition is reserved for
Chris Tavares.  The IMAGEN configuration definition has slightly more
utility, but is also best left turned off except at Imagen.  At this
point they should replace "defprf.e" with "defprf.ico" or "defprf.ima"
respectively (saving the original defprf.e as defprf.def).
	If you are using a SUN system, replace "defprf.e" with
"defprf.sun".  But see the additional documentation about SUN ELLE
farther on in this file; you may have to settle for BSD4_2 instead.

(3.3) TX_TERMCAP:
	Normally the TERMCAP library is included so that ELLE can
support more terminals than just the ones "hard-wired" into the
program.  However, if you decide not to use TERMCAP, either because you
don't have it, or because it is too large (see the next step [4]), do the
following:
	- Change the setting of TX_TERMCAP to zero.
	- Enable the appropriate hard-wired terminal types (or add your
		own to eeterm.c).
	- Edit "Makefile" or "v6load.sh" to remove the string "-ltermlib".

(3.4) STKMEM:
	The STKMEM definition is very important for PDP-11s, especially
those without split I/D.  Otherwise, it should probably be left
commented out.

(3.5) EVHELPFILE:
	You should copy the file "help.dat" to some publicly readable
(but not writeable!) location, and define EVHELPFILE to point at this
location.  The default location is "/usr/src/elle/help.dat".

(3.6) Other stuff:
	There are many additional parameters which can be set to modify
things for your particular configuration.  See the definitions at the
start of the files "elle.h" and "eevini.c" for a list of these.  Try
the defaults first, however; and please refrain from editing anything
but "eesite.h" if possible.


[4] SPACE WAR AND DEFPRF.E
	Does your system have a limited address space?  If you are on a
32-bit machine such as the VAX, or the "-i" switch works for your CC
and LD, you don't have this problem.  However, if you are using a
16-bit machine without "split I/D" -- separate address spaces for
instructions and data -- then you do.  Currently the only machines
known to have this problem are certain PDP-11 models such as the 11/23,
11/34, 11/40, and 11/60.  (Note: the 11/24, 11/44, 11/45, 11/50, and
11/70 do have split I/D and are okay!) If you have one of these problem
machines then you should do the following:
	- Substitute "-n" for the "-i" switch in "Makefile".
	- Enable the STKMEM definition in eesite.h (change "0" to "1")
	- Consider setting TX_TERMCAP to zero in eesite.h, especially
		if you only use ELLE with terminal types that
		are already hardwired in eeterm.c.
	- Edit a new version of defprf.e to remove some functions.  One of the
		largest and least needed functions is "Debug Mode"
		and you should start by commenting that one out, as well
		as "Hit Breakpoint".
		Other possibilities are "Describe", "Query Replace" and
		"Replace String", "Set Fill Prefix" and "Auto Fill Mode",
		the "Keyboard Macro" functions, and so on.

[5] LET'S DO IT...
	A. To build everything with "make", just invoke "make".
		NOTE: for an APOLLO system, say "make apolloelle" instead!
		NOTE: for a  SUN      "   ,  "  "make sunelle"       "
		NOTE: for a  PC/IX    "   ,  "  "make pcixelle"      "

		If you modify any modules, invoke "make" again.

	B. To build everything with V6 runfiles, do:
		v6init.sh
		v6load.sh -i   (or "v6load.sh -n" if you don't have split I/D)

		If you modify any modules, re-build with:
			v6cc.sh <module1> <module2> ...
			v6load.sh <-i or -n>

	C. To build everything on TOPS-20, do:
		[@]DO eeconf.mic
		[@]DO ee.mic

If any errors happen, fix them as best as you can.  All compilation
errors and their fixes should be reported back to the maintainer so
your solutions need not be re-discovered independently.  Any errors in
the SB library routines have the potential for great and subtle
lossage so be careful there.

The resulting binary will normally be called "xelle".  Test it out
there before installing it as "elle".


[6] DEFAULT PROFILE - THE PROFILE COMPILER
	The ELLEC (ELLE profile compiler) program is built as a side
	effect of the "make" or "v6init.sh".  It is only needed to generate a
	non-standard configuration or to change the default user profile.  It
	can be installed publicly if you wish to allow users to define their
	own user profiles (see next section).


[7] A LAST WORD ON FILE MODS
	The intent of the current file setup is that the ONLY source
	files which may need editing are "eesite.h" and "defprf.e".
	If you find it necessary to modify other files besides these,
	you should definitely relay your changes back to the maintainer.


CUSTOMIZING ELLE - User Profiles (default and otherwise)

	ELLE supports a crude form of "user profile" that currently
only allows specification of key bindings (SUN users may also specify a
mouse menu).  Normally when ELLE starts up, it uses a default built-in
"profile" which is defined by the file "defprf.c" at compile time
(itself derived from "defprf.e").  This file defines all of the ELLE
commands by binding functions to specific keys; for example, all
printable ASCII chars are normally bound to the function "Insert Self".

	A user can specify changes in the default bindings by creating
a file called ".ellepro.e" in the $HOME directory.  This is an ASCII text
file containing binding definitions; see ELLEC.C for a description of
the format.  Running ELLEC with the command "ellec -Profile" causes the
user's profile to be "compiled" into a binary format file.  When ELLE starts
up, it will look for this binary file and if found it will be loaded.

	You cannot create new functions with profile specifications;
you can only map keyboard commands to functions which ELLE already
contains.  The file "deffun.e" describes all of the functions that ELLE
knows about; note that not all of them may have been compiled into your
version of ELLE.  Which are included is decided by "defprf.e".

FILE DEPENDENCIES

When considering any changes to the default user profile, or to the
functions ELLE knows about, you must take note of certain file
dependencies.  The following diagram shows how things are
interconnected:

			   /---<-----------------<--|-->-------->---\
			   |			    |               |
			   |	   /--> eefdef.h -->|               |
        deffun.e >-->|	   |	   |--> eefidx.h -->|               |
        defprf.e >-->|     |       |--> defprf.c -->|               |
		     |--> ELLEC >->|                          |--> ELLE
$HOME/.ellepro.e >-->|             |--> $HOME/.ellepro.b1 >-->|

    Data files (input to ELLEC)		  #include files (both ELLE and ELLEC)
deffun.e   = Master (defines functs)	eefdef.h = defines funct names/addrs
defprf.e   = Default Profile map	eefidx.h = defines FN_ and FX_ values
.ellepro.e = User Profile map		defprf.c = default profile data

					  Data file for ELLE runtime use
					.ellepro.b1 = binary user profile

The most crucial file is deffun.e, which establishes the correspondence
between function names, function indices, and ELLE routines; this file
is the ultimate master reference.  defprf.e specifies the default user
profile.  If either of these is changed, ELLEC must be run in order to
generate new versions of the .h files, which can then be directly
compiled into ELLE (and ELLEC as well).  The Makefile attempts to
enforce this dependency; you should avoid hand-editing the .h files
unless a truly vicious circularity seems to be present.

To change the default profile (defprf.e) that ELLE uses:
	Edit defprf.e to get the desired default profile.
	Say "make".  This should cause ELLEC to be invoked,
		re-generating the necessary .h files and rebuilding ELLE.
	Recompile ELLEC with "make ellec" so it knows about the
		new defaults.

Additions to deffun.e (new functions) just require re-MAKEing ELLE
and ELLEC, in that order.  Actual changes to function names, or changes in the
existing function ordering, are NOT recommended.  However, if it becomes
necessary, this is what needs to be done:
	Change deffun.e as desired.
	Re-make ELLE and ELLEC with "make" and "make ellec".
		Do not install either yet.
	Disable all use of ELLE and ELLEC for the next step.
	Run the new ELLEC over all profiles on your system.
		If function names were changed, you may have to edit
		each user profile to change the names therein.
	Install new ELLE and ELLEC and allow use.

Also note that any changes to deffun.e will usually require some
changes to the file "help.dat" if the "Describe" command is to know
about new functions or whatever.

MODIFYING ELLE - advice on making local "improvements"

	In general, be cautious; bugs introduced into an editor have the
	potential to corrupt any file that the editor touches!

	Remember that ELLE was intended to furnish EMACS-like editing
for small systems, particularly non-split PDP-11s.  It is
extraordinarily easy to run wild with new features and extensions and
completely blow the program out of its original 16-bit address space
bounds.  Note that this address space must include both instructions
and data!  Those people who live on larger machines should be
especially careful about thoughtless additions -- if they screw the
non-split 16-bit version I will just have to take them out or remove
something else.  If you are too frustrated, perhaps you really want to
use some other editors whose authors live on 32-bit machines.  There
are many features which I have not added, for just this reason.

	To really extend things farther will require that someone
develop a compact and efficient "macro-language" which ELLE can
interpret at run-time.  Adding this extensibility is non-trivial since
it must support basic programming constructs.

	It is much better to write new command-key (f_) functions than
to modify existing ones, and it is MUCH better to change functions than
to change the core routines of ELLE.  This is because new functions can
be selectively compiled, but the core routines must always be included.
As of ELLE 3.0, it is now possible to provide functions which are only
compiled and loaded if the default user profile requires them.  This
allows ELLE to be built in different ways depending on your system; you
can include all known functions if you have no space problems, or
specify just the essential ones if you need a small version of ELLE.  I
expect that future releases will continue the trend of increasing
modularity and ease of customization.

	In general any questions as to default command key mappings,
and the actions of specific functions, are resolved by trying to do
what the original ITS TECO EMACS does.  A few things may be slightly
different for compelling efficiency reasons.  Future releases may
begin to emulate GNU Emacs rather than TECO EMACS.

	The SB library package is the single most important key to
ELLE's operation and performance.  Don't even THINK about hacking this
package unless you are very, very, very certain you understand how
things work.  It is too easy for subtle errors to cause file damage
months later.  Although the performance can doubtless be improved,
these modules weren't really meant to be hackable, and many of the
comments in the code remain speculative.

	Lastly, please relay your bug fixes and improvements back to me
for inclusion in new versions.  (See the contact information in the
"00read.me" file).  ELLE is reasonably stable from the user's
viewpoint, but I am still tweaking it occasionally in response to
suggestions, complaints, or daydreams.

SUN ELLE - Differences & Notes

	[NOTE: When SunView was introduced, the SUN version of ELLE
	stopped working.  Until this is fixed, users of new SUNs will have
	to use the BSD4_2 compilation flag rather than the SUN flag,
	and no mouse capabilities are available.]

	When ELLE is built for a SUN workstation system, code will
be included which interacts with the SUN window system to make text
editing a bit more efficient.  Outside the window system, it functions
just like normal ELLE; inside the window system, the user can perform
some functions with the mouse alone.  Andy Poggio of SRI is responsible
for these additions.

BUILDING NOTES:
	SUN ELLE has a specially patched "tool_select" procedure that
calls "my_select" instead of "select".  "my_select" clears the input
flag bit for the tty subwindow and then calls "select".  This should
all be handled by specifying "make sunelle" when you build ELLE (ADB is
invoked to perform the patch).  Of course this hack will break if a new
library version of "tool_select" is distributed from SUN.
	Prior to invoking "make", you should copy "defprf.sun" to
"defprf.e" in order to get the default SUN configuration.
	Finally, the ELLEC program needs to be installed in order for
menus to work.


Cursors:
	With SUN ELLE there are two cursors: the familiar rectangular
ELLE cursor and the new, hexagonal mouse cursor.  The ELLE cursor works
as it always has; the mouse cursor tracks the mouse position.

Mouse buttons:
	Mouse buttons may be used singly or in combination and, with
one exception, take effect on release.

	Left   - Go there.  Puts ELLE cursor where mouse cursor is.
	Middle - Set mark there.  Sets ELLE mark where mouse cursor is.
	Right  - Menu display.  This is just like other Sun window tools
		and displays the menu when the button is pressed.  Releasing
		the button selects a menu item.  For setting up your ELLE
		menu, see below.
	Left and middle - Backward Delete Character.  Deletes the character
		to the left of the ELLE cursor.
	Middle and right - no operation
	Left, middle, and right - no operation

Setting Up your ELLE Menu:

	To set up your own menu, you must create a "profile" file
called ".ellepro.e" in your home directory, if it does not already exist.
Add one line for each menu item you wish, in the format:
		(menuitem "Name")
where "Name" can be any official ELLE function name, such as "Query
Replace".  All of the possible official function names are listed in
the file "deffun.e"; their names are the same as their EMACS
counterparts.  They must be spelled exactly as they are in this file.

An example of an ELLE menu profile is:

	(menuitem "Goto Beginning")
	(menuitem "Goto End")
	(menuitem "Next Screen")
	(menuitem "Previous Screen")
	(menuitem "Query Replace")
	(menuitem "Previous Screen")
	(menuitem "Return to Superior")

	After creating or modifying your .ellepro.e file, you should run
the program "ellec -Profile" in order to compile it into a fast-load
format for ELLE.  When you next start ELLE, you can invoke your menu at
any time by using the right mouse button.  To be able to quit ELLE from
your menu, include "Return to Superior" as a menu item.  The menu
length is currently limited to ten items.

Bugs:
	Menu length should not be so limited.
	Andy claims Push to Inferior does not work.
