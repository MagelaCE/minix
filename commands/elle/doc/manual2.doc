                             VI.  GLOSSARY



ASCII
     The American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
     This is the "8-level code" and is like an alphabet.  There
     are 128 possible characters in the ASCII alphabet, and the
     standard says what each character looks like.  For example,
     character #65 is "A", character #13 is RETURN, etc.
     Most computers today are using ASCII so that they can agree
     on what each character means.

BUFFER
     A temporary "book" made by ELLE which you can work on.
     It becomes a permanent file in the computer "library"
     only when you ask for it to be "saved" or "written out".
     ELLE lets you have many buffers (each with its own name),
     and any time you want you can select a different buffer to
     work on.

BUFFER NAME
     Just like a real file or "book", each buffer must have
     a buffer name.  If you created the buffer yourself you
     can use any name you like.  When ELLE makes the buffer for
     you (like when you use CTRL-X CTRL-F for "Find File"), it
     will normally give the buffer the same name as the file.
     Two buffers cannot have the same name.

CHARACTER
     A letter, digit, punctuation mark, or formatting control
     such as space or tab.  Everything you see on the screen is
     a character.  Anything you send to the computer is a character.

CONTROL CHARACTERS
     These are characters that you make by holding down the CONTROL
     key while you type a letter.  We talk about them as CONTROL-X or
     CTRL-X.  On the screen they look like ^X.

CURSOR
     The blinking "underline" or "block" on the screen.  It shows
     where characters will be inserted or deleted.  "Moving" in
     ELLE means moving the cursor to the place where you want to
     do something.

EMACS
     The very powerful text editor developed at Massachusetts Institute
     of Technology that is used for the basis of ELLE.

FILE

                                - 31 -










     Like a computer "book".  A file contains text; it can be empty
     (no text at all) or it can hold hundreds of thousands of characters.

FILENAME
     The name of a file.  Exactly like the "title" of a book.
     You can use any names you want as long as you follow
     certain rules.  The name should not be longer than 13 letters,
     and should not have any punctuation marks or spaces in it.

FILLING
     Adjusting the lines to a specific length.

MARK
     An "invisible cursor" that stays where you set it (with
     CTRL-@).  The mark is used to define a "region" of text.

PARAGRAPH
     Text from one indented line to the next indented line.
     This is important for the ESC Q command.

REGION
     All the text between the cursor and the last "mark" that you set.
     A region is what CTRL-W wipes out.

SCREEN
     The full picture on the tv screen of the terminal.

SEARCH
     To look for a given place in the text.  ELLE will search either
     backward or forward for a particular string.  If you ask ELLE
     to search for the string "he", you may be moved to the "he" in
     the word "here" or the word "there" or the word "she"....

STRING
     Just like "text", a series of characters.  "String" usually
     implies a specific short piece of text.
     See SEARCH.

TEXT
     Any group of characters (letters).  A file is made of text;
     a book is made of printed text; this paragraph is an
     example of text.  On the computer, text can only be composed
     of ASCII characters.

TEXT EDITOR
     A computer program that lets you change (modify, edit) text.
     ELLE is a text editor that lets you work with text in buffers,
     files, and messages.

WINDOW
     A part of the screen that shows you what is in a buffer.
     The screen is not very big, so usually you cannot see
     all of the buffer.  A real window does not let you see
     everything outside; an ELLE window does not let you see

                                - 32 -










     everything in a buffer, unless the buffer is small enough
     to all fit inside the window.
     You can have one or two windows.  With two windows, you
     can either look at two buffers at the same time, or
     at two different places in the same buffer.

WORD PROCESSOR
     What a salesman calls a text editor.
