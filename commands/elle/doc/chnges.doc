ELLE CHANGES:
	This file attempts to summarize the changes made to ELLE from
version to version.

ELLE 4.1:
	Various functions added for MINIX.
	Source files greatly re-organized; #ifdefs changed to #ifs.

ELLE 4.0:
	Primarily a new source version, with almost all source files renamed
	to fit a 6-char limit.  TOPS-20 conditionals added.
	One new command:
	  ^X ^M - Toggle EOL mode.  This sets a per-buffer flag which
		says whether lines are ended with ASCII LF or CR-LF.
		This is primarily for the benefit of systems like TOPS-20.

ELLE 3.0c:	SUN code additions (Andy Poggio)
	Speeded up SUN console screen update, and added two new functions:
	  M-R - "Select Region"
	  M-S - "Stuff Selection"
	A new file, e_profdef.sun, exists for setting up a standard SUN
	configuration.
ELLE 3.0b: SUN code brought up to date.
ELLE 3.0a:
	Fix to make ^X E accept numeric repeat-count argument.
	Bug fixes and minor improvements to the SB routines.
	Bug fix to R-search.

ELLE 3.0:
	The major change is not user-visible: the configuration setup for
	ELLE has been made more flexible so it is easier to specify your
	own favorite version of things.  Accordingly, the default
	ELLE configuration has been expanded to include more functions.
	The instructions for building ELLE have been updated and should
	be reviewed even by people who have built ELLE versions before.

	New commands:
	  ^_   - "Describe".  Asks user for a command and shows
		a brief description of what it does.
	  M-G  - "Fill Region".
	  ^X . - "Set Fill Prefix".
	  ^X T - "Auto Fill Mode" toggle.

	A "Keyboard Macro" feature is now standard:
		^X ( to start collecting a keyboard macro.
		^X ) to stop collecting.
		^X E to execute the collected macro.
		^X * to display the collected macro.
	Currently there can only be one keyboard macro.

	^X ^V (Visit File) now defined for benefit of EMACS folk;
	same as ^X ^R (Read File). 

	^X ^Z (Return to Superior) now pauses the editor so it can be
	continued later, without asking for confirmation.  This only works
	when the environment allows it (system has SIGTSTP and user is
	using new tty discipline); otherwise behavior is the same as before
	and ELLE asks for confirmation before quitting.  The latter action
	can always be forced by using ^U ^X ^Z no matter what the system.
		
	By popular demand, hangup of the terminal (SIGHUP) is now caught,
	and will cause ELLE to write out all modified buffers to
	files named $HOME/+<buffername>.  Note the potential for gronkage
	if you are modifying very large files.

	Bug fix for ^X ^B (List Buffers) on long-filename systems.
	Bug fixes for getcap in e_trm.c.
	Bug fix to Replace String.

ELLE 2.8e:
	IMAGEN conditionals integrated.  Bug fix to Kill Buffer.
ELLE 2.8d:
	Bug fix to sbm's realloc (affected TERMCAP).
ELLE 2.8c:
	ELLE now checks access before writing to a filename.  If
	the file exists but does not permit write access, ELLE will not
	write out the buffer.  Thus, read-only files cannot be "over-written".
	The explicit check is needed because ELLE never actually overwrites
	old files; it only renames them.

	New command: C-X %	"Replace String"

ELLE 2.8b:
	Minor aesthetic tweaks to Select Buffer and Next Screen.

	Find File checks for access errors before creating a new buffer.

	Universal Arg (^U) now behaves more like EMACS, accepting
	a numeric argument after invocation.

	Integration of SUN workstation code from Andy Poggio; allows
	use of SUN mouse to move around and select up to 10 menu functions.

ELLE 2.8a:
	Very minor fixes; mostly integration of some conditionalized
	but untested ICONOGRAPHICS code.

	Screen updates which use line insert/delete operations have
	been improved.

	Improved handling of "rug-pull" situations which arise when a
	file that ELLE is actively reading gets over-written by some other
	program (such as ED).  ELLE cannot detect all such cases, but
	for those where previously a fatal error would result,
	ELLE now warns the user of file corruption and continues.

ELLE 2.8:
	Incremental Search is now the default function for ^S.
	It acts almost exactly like Incremental Search in EMACS.
	In particular, an ESC with an empty search string will
	invoke the String Search function (the previous default, where
	you type a complete line before the search starts).  As before,
	unlike EMACS a CR is treated as a string terminator similar to ESC.

	The other major user-visible change is that ^X ^Z (to exit ELLE) now
	only asks you ONCE if you really want to quit.  If there are
	any modified buffers, ELLE will tell you about them, but will
	NOT ask if you wish to save them -- only if you really want to
	exit.  This simplifies the procedure and allows the user to
	save the buffers in whichever way is best.

	Fatal error handling will now output a message and wait
	for user input.  The buffer is not saved automatically to
	the file "ELLE.crash" as before.  If the user types a "S"
	in response to the "(A,B,C,D,S,W,?)" prompt, the current
	buffer will be saved; if a "W" is typed, all modified
	buffers will be saved.  Buffer writing is now done at
	a very low level to reduce the chances of bugs in the
	saving routine.  Any saved buffers will be written
	to the files $HOME/+buffername.  For example, if you have
	a modified buffer called "foo", and your home directory
	is "/a/user", then the buffer will be written to the
	file "/a/user/+foo", and ELLE will tell you that it is doing so.
	(I am open to suggestions for better filenames.)
	Users are not expected to remember this, since fatal errors
	are not supposed to happen (hah!).  I think there is
	sufficient prompting that the right course of action will be
	clear enough.  Such errors should of course be reported so
	I can investigate them.

	Less visible changes are those which fix a number of minor bugs.
	The most serious was one where certain redisplay situations
	could make ^X O (Go to Other Window) enter an infinite loop!
	Other code revisions were of a cosmetic nature, to make
	ELLE more portable to different machines and C compilers.

	A lot of effort was spent making disk I/O more efficient by preserving
	byte and block alignment where it made sense to do so.  The number
	of system calls for memory allocation has also been much reduced.
	The result is that some operations such as searching through a
	large file have become much faster (I measured a roughly 300%
	improvement for some files).

	The output of ^X ^B (List Buffers) is now lined up better.

ELLE 2.7:
	If ELLE is invoked with two filename arguments, both files
	will be read in, using two windows.

	Insert-char on typein is slightly faster (not real noticeable).

	User profiles can be defined.

ELLE 2.6:
	New commands:
		C-X K	Kill Buffer
		M-[	Backward Paragraph
		M-]	Forward Paragraph
		M-H	Mark Paragraph
		C-M-W	Append Next Kill
		M-T	Transpose Word

	Changes:
		C-X ^	Grow Window - was C-X G but changed to follow EMACS.
		C-X F	Set Fill Column - now acts as in EMACS.
				Sets the fill column to argument.
				With no arg, sets to column cursor is in.
		C-T	Transpose Character - fixed to work like EMACS.

	Misc fixes:

		It is still possible to have too many files open, so that
	you cannot read in any more.  However, ELLE now will never be
	prevented from writing files out, and one can use the Kill Buffer
	command to make room for new files.
		ELLE now preserves the UID and GID of edited files, if
	possible (i.e. if user is SU).
		If TERMCAP claims that your terminal has a META or EDIT
	key (as per items km, mm, mo), ELLE will try to allow its use.
	Previously there was no way to know if a meta-key existed unless
	the terminal was a DM2500.  If for any reason ELLE's guess is
	wrong, you can force 7-bit or 8-bit input by giving the switches
	"-7" or "-8" in the ELLE command line.
		M-V works a little better.
